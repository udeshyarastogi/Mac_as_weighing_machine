# TrackWeight

**Turn your MacBook's trackpad into a precise digital weighing scale**

TrackWeight is a macOS application that transforms your MacBook's trackpad into a digital weighing scale by leveraging the Force Touch pressure sensors built into modern MacBook trackpads.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📦 Use your MacBook's Force Touch trackpad as a **precision weight sensor**
- 🧪 Real-time pressure tracking and weight estimation
- 🎛️ Intuitive user interface to display and calibrate weight
- 🖥️ Native macOS UI (Swift / SwiftUI / AppKit based)
- ⚙️ Lightweight and optimized for performance

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

TrackWeight uses macOS APIs to access pressure data from the Force Touch trackpad. It then maps the pressure values to weight measurements using a calibration system that adjusts for individual MacBook hardware characteristics.
